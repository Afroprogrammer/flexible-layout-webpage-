<h1>HANNIBAL - THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
<p>
After defeating the Romans at the battle of lake Trasimene, Hannibal
now moved his forces down south. There was panic in Rome and Quintus 
Fabius Maximus was appointed dictator to deal with Hannibal. Fabius,
however, refused to meet Hannibal in the Open field and his Strategy
became highly unpopular in Rome. Romans were used to attacking, not 
hidding, The Romans were forced to go on the offensive after Hannibal
positioned his forces between Rome and its vital grain supply. This 
setup the epic Battle of Cannae. Here Hannibal defeated the Romans 
inflicting the worst single day defeat in Rome's history.
</p>
<h1> AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
<p> After the horrific defeat at the battle of Cannae, the romans reinstittuted Fabius'
avoidance strategy. the Romans no longer refused to meetHannibal in Head on collisions.
Rather the Roman army kept a watchful eye on Hannibal, but always at a close distance.</p>

<p> The avoidance strategy worked but it took forever. It took almost two long decades to drive 
Hannibal out of Italy. And even then Hannibal was never defeated in Italy. The Romans, adopting a tactic
of the Hannibals playbook, Launched an attack against Carthage itself. This forced Hannibal to travel back to Africa
to defend the city. Here he was Defeated in the Battle of Zama.
